# Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface aided Receive Quadrature Index Modulation for 6G networks

One of the most critical aspects of enabling next-generation wireless technologies is developing an accurate and consistent channel model to be validated effectively with the help of real-world measurements. From this point of view, remarkable research has recently been conducted to model propagation channels involving the modification of the wireless propagation environment through the inclusion of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS). By aiding RIS with Receive Quadrature Reflecting Modulation (RQRM), one of the Spatial Modulation techniques using a single antenna at the transmitter side and selecting a particular receiving antenna at the receiver side by dividing RIS into two parts â€“ In phase (I) and Quadrature (Q) which lead to low Signal to Noise Ratio(SNR), high bitrate and low Bit Error Rate (BER).

We can extend the concept of RIS-RQRM by replacing RQRM with other novel Spatial Modulation techniques to achieve better performance in terms of SNR, bitrate, and BER thereby further enhancing the spectrum and energy efficiency of next-generation wireless systems.
